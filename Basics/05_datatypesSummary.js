/* 
Datatypes are Primitive and Derived/Referenced
All primitive datatypes are call by value type, ie a copy
of the values is given for usage but not the original 
memory reference of the values.

7 Types:
String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, 
symbol (for unique values), BigInt

Referenced or Derived or Non Primitive Datatypes: the original
memory reference of these datatypes can be directly allocated
for usage

Types:
Array, Object, Functions

Java script is a dynamically typed language which means 
the type is associated with run time values and not with
named variables/fields etc. While a statically typed language
is one in which the the type of variable is known at compile
time
 
Statically typed language: datatypes of variables are checked
at compile time and are not allowed to changed in runtime

Dynamically typed language: datatypes of variables are
checked in runtime and can be changed after execution
as well
